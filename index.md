## Overview

<img src="images/iLab-computers.jpeg" alt="iLabs" width="300">

The iLab is a gaming lounge on the campus of UH Manoa for UH Mānoa students, faculty and staff, and is open on weekdays 10:30 a.m.–6 p.m. Members are able to to come and game, learn about esports, and meet other people who are interested in esports. It is also a great place to relax and destress with your friends as the semester progresses.

There are many students that come to the ilab, especially during the first couple weeks of school, that don't have anyone to play with as most of their usual friends may not go to UH. It may be easier to enjoy your time at the iLab lounge if you are able to make new groups, meet new friends, and learn more about the community by being a part of it.

The iCompanion web application sorts UH students using similar, interests, available times, etc and connects them with each other, allowing for the process of forming connections and making friends easier.
